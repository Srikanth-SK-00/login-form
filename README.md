This is a README file that provides an overview and instructions for implementing a login, signup, and email verification system using Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and several NPM packages. The system allows users to create an account, log in, and verify their email address before gaining access to the application.

Technologies Used

          Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
          MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
          HTML: A markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web.
          CSS: A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
          NPM Packages:
          bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords securely.
          body-parser: A middleware for parsing the request body in Node.js.
          express: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
          mongoose: An object modeling tool for MongoDB.
          nodemailer: A module for sending emails using Node.js.
          nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.
          otp-generator: A library for generating one-time passwords (OTPs).
Prerequisites
          Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

          Node.js: Download and install Node.js
          MongoDB: Download and install MongoDB
Getting Started
Clone the repository from GitHub:

    git clone <repository-url>
  
Change to the project directory:

     cd <project-directory>
  
Install the project dependencies:

     npm install
  
Configure the MongoDB connection:

      Open the config.js file located in the config directory.
      Update the DB_CONNECTION property with your MongoDB connection string.
      Configure the email service (SMTP):

      Open the config.js file located in the config directory.
      Update the SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, and SMTP_PASSWORD properties with your email service provider's information. This is required for sending verification emails
      
Start the application:

       npm start

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
